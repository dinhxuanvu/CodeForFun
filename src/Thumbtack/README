*** INSTRUCTION ***
1. Prepration
+ Untar the thumbtack.tar.gz to your location of choice
+ Go to directory where Thumbtack folder exists

2. Compile the program
+ Run the following command:
$ javac Thumbtack/Program.java Thumbtack/SimpleDatabase.java

*Note: $ is just a prompt, not a part of the command

3. Run the program
+ You can run program as:
$ java Thumbtack.Program [textfile]
+ with 'textfile' is the path + filename of your text file

+ For example: If you want to run the test case 1 inside the Thumbtack folder, run the following command:
$ java Thumbtack.Program Thumbtack/test1

+ If you want to run using input command, run the following command:
$ java Thumbtack.Program
+ then enter your commands (one by one followed by ENTER)

4. Extras:
The thumbtack.tar contains 11 following files (2 java files, one README and 8 test cases):
+ Program.java
+ SimpleDatabase.java
+ README
+ test[1-8] (8 files)

5. Notes:
Since the challenge description doesn't specific if the value has to be numbers or a specific type, 
I assume the program can accept any kind of values. If the program is supposed to accept only integer 
value, regular expression (string.matches("\\d+")) can be used to verify the input before put to database.

Also, the program is strictly following the command format that the challenge requires so it won't allow 
any "partially-correct" to go through.
