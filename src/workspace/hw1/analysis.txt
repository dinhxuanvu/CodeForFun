* C++ Program 

i. Positives:
	1. Program easy to understand because they are divided into classes and methods. The classes and methods are all connected to demonstrate the functionality of the program.
	2. The details of the algorithm are hidden, hence we don't have to write the implementation of the trivial methods such as size(), begin() and etc?
	3. C++ provides exception handling to check the error during compile and runtime.
	4. C++ has objects which could have any different primitive types within one object. Objects would give programmers the flexibility to use inheritance and polymorphism.
	5. Don't have to implicitly assign the specific memory for the variables in the program since the compiler would handle on its own.
	6. C++ has rich library which has a lot of useful and already-written methods and functions that programmers could use them in their programs without implementing them again.

ii. Negatives:
1. Poor performance because C++ has exception handling which causes the program to run slower. 
2. More complicated syntax for classes and advanced features which could be difficult to follow.

* C Program

i. Positives:
1. More efficient implementation because programmers have control over low-level of code such as pointers and memory.
2. Simpler syntax since C doesn't have classes or any advanced features that C++ has.
3. C doesn?t have overhead features such as exception handling which would boost the performance of the program.

ii. Negatives:
1. Program more difficult to follow because it is organized into classes or objects. Instead, everything is built as a struct.
2. Have to implement all of data structures and functions because there are no collections or complex types.
